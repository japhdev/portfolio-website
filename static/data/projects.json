Built with Swift, it uses Firebase for secure email authentication and a powerful database to keep everything organized.\n\nUsers can manage employees, assign work hours, schedule vacations, and generate PDF reports to share with contacts quickly and efficiently. This app boosts productivity and helps businesses stay in control of their team schedules with ease.",
